I'm back in the UK after a week in Sweden.

As always, I was thrilled to get into my own car at the airport. I love [that thing](https://hond.ae/), and I love the drive back.

It was slightly magical to get home – our wisteria in full bloom, church bells ringing, evening falling on the valley.

At work, I made a [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) SQL-backed dashboard showing the progress of something we're rolling out.

ChatGPT, for all its faults, turned out to be an amazing Metabase collaborator.

I gave it a fairly detailed description of the tables I had and the kind of diagram I wanted, and the query it returned *worked perfectly*. I can figure out fairly advanced stuff in SQL, but it will take me a while, and this was a huge time saver.

I kept using it to evolve the dashboard and it kept being incredibly useful.

I watched a bunch of stuff.

[Dark City (1998)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/). Rewatch. Not very good. I'm astounded that IMDb reviewers seem to find the plot profound.

[The Gallows Pole (2023–)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14676562/) is set in one of our neighbouring villages and filmed in another. I watched the first 2 episodes – decent, with some well done naturalistic dialogue. I'm genuinely offended by the ungrammatical "Old English" in the credits and episode titles. "Booketh" as a noun? "Thy had a dream"? Stupid.

I didn't expect to like [Renfield (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11358390/), but I did. Funny, good action sequences, good cast.

[The World's End (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213663/) was pretty good. Lots of [callbacks](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213663/trivia/).

And I went on a Buster Keaton binge. [Sherlock Jr. (1924)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015324/) (fantastic), [The General (1926)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017925/) (likewise) and [Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019421/) (some incredible scenes but not as good overall). It's amazing to think that this was nearly 100 years ago. With a well-told story, you don't really notice or care that it's black and white and silent. Highly recommend.

On the Saturday, we went to [the Royal Armouries in Leeds](https://royalarmouries.org/) for a Wild West show – it's one of my partner's many special interests. It was a lovely day out.

On the Sunday, we gardened and had amazing BBQ under a parasol.

I'm very excited about Apple's WWDC keynote tomorrow, with the rumoured AR/VR headset. I see a lot of promise that hasn't been realised yet.

I enjoyed:

- [Wikipedia: Buster Keaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Keaton). What a life.
- [YouTube: How does Bluetooth work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I1vxu5qIUM&ab_channel=BranchEducation) Technology is magic.
