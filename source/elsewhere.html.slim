      I'm [@henrik@ruby.social](https://ruby.social/@henrik) on Mastodon, and evaluating Bluesky as [@henrik.nyh.se](https://bsky.app/profile/henrik.nyh.se). Say hi!

      My [Instagram](https://instagram.com/henrikn) has photos of our cats and our lovely corner of the world.

      I blog sporadically at [The Pug Automatic](https://thepugautomatic.com) about Ruby, Elixir, Vim etc.

      I save links to [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:henrik), books to [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3135242-henrik-n), films to [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/henrikn/).

      I have some open source work on GitHub â€“ as [@henrik](https://github.com/henrik) and [for my employer](https://github.com/barsoom). (Including [this site](https://github.com/henrik/henrik.nyh.se).)
