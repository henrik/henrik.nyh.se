    h2#desk Desk setup

    markdown:

      I work from a home office overlooking our back garden. Aiming for a kind of mid century modern retro sci-fi explorer's lounge aesthetic.

      * **14" MacBook Air (M2, 2022)**. "Midnight", 16 GB RAM, 512 GB storage. With a [gold Apple logo](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1044558826/coloured-apple-apple-macbook-decal). Love it.
      * **Apple Studio Display**. I love the single-cable life.
      * **Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID** (Swedish layout), and a **Magic Trackpad**. Not having to reach for the laptop for Touch ID is a great quality-of-life improvement.
      * [Black Autonomous SmartDesk frame](https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/diy-smart-desk-kit?option16=37&option17=1881) with a [walnut effect table top](https://www.onlinereality.co.uk/prod/13424/nextday-laminated-mdf-table-tops). I like that it has height presets.
      * [Walnut and brass monitor stand](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/794506621/beech-wood-monitor-stand-laptop-stand?ref=yr_purchases&variation0=1386049109).
      * [mStand](https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html) for the MBP. Usually open as a second screen.
      * **EasyErgo Executive Mesh office chair**. A revelation after my previous not-so-ergonomic chair. Concave arm rests are <i>amazing</i>.
      * [HyperX Gold Cloud Alpha](https://www.hyperxgaming.com/unitedkingdom/en/landing/cloud-alpha-gold) headset. I'm a sucker for black and gold. Works well. Wired; haven't found a wireless headset I like.

    h2#mac On my Mac

    markdown:

      * [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) ([since 2010](https://thepugautomatic.com/2011/01/textmate-to-vim-with-training-wheels/)) in [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) in [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [my dotfiles](https://github.com/henrik/dotfiles). Vim uses a dark theme called [Blackboard](https://github.com/henrik/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/colors/blackboard.vim). Monaco font.

    markdown:

      * [Arc browser](https://arc.net/). A quirky power-user browser rethinking web browsing from first principles.

        With [a retro Netscape-style shooting stars icon](https://arc.net/e/EB39BD1B-960E-4DF4-A41B-3C52F402C743) for nostalgia and because it's more recognisable in the dock.

        I don't use a desktop email client; just Gmail in a pinned Arc tab. I have a pretty organised Gmail setup using "Multiple Inboxes" and filters.
      * [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/).

        I wanted to like Apple Music, but the UX is just not there, though it handles local files better.

        p Hand Mirror (no longer used), xbar (no longer used), Tuple, Mic Drop, Fantastical, iStat Menus.
        p Configuring the clock to show seconds is great for meetings.

    markdown:

      * [Tuple](https://tuple.app/) for remote pair programming.
      * [Mic Drop](https://getmicdrop.com/) for a global mute/unmute shortcut.

        It's great to have a consistent shortcut between Tuple/Zoom/Google Meet. This does mean I sometimes end up double-muted and confused (in Mic Drop *and* the meeting).

        It gives peace of mind to see mute status in the menu bar, just like you effectively see the camera indicator light there.
      * [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) to enter calendar events in natural language via a menu bar icon, and to list them there.
      * [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) to show memory, CPU, network activity and battery status of peripherals.

        To avoid clutter it only shows the computer's battery status in the menu bar, and I click it to see the rest.
      * [SuperDuper!](https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/) for full-disk backups before OS upgrades and such.
      * [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for notes.

        Took a while to win me over from Apple Notes, but now I've fallen far down the nerd hole.
      * **iCloud Drive**. Mostly fine, if you keep version-controlled code outside it. (Otherwise it will duplicate files.)
      * [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/). Launcher, clipboard history, putting the computer to sleep etc. Their AI chat is very low-friction to access and has nice integrations (e.g. with selected text).

        I've made automations to e.g. launch standard Zooms and Google Meets. I like how automations can be just a folder of scripts.
      * [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/) for window management.

        Raycast also does window management, but Divvy has two features I'd miss: a shortcut to open a grid panel where you can visually drag to pick size and position, and hitting a shortcut twice to use that arrangement but on the other display.

    markdown:

      * [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) for animated screen captures.
      * [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) to optimise images.
      * [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) for image editing.
      * [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com/) to free up disk space.
      * [Ice Cubes](https://apps.apple.com/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884) for Mastodon. A bit unpolished, but it's the best client I've found so far.

    h2#phone On my iPhone

    markdown:

      * [Castro](https://castro.fm/) for podcasts. Has a genius inbox-centric workflow that no one else comes near.
      * [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) for email. Love how I can set different swipes to quickly move or snooze emails, and how I can swipe between different signatures (e.g. different languages and formality).
      * [Ice Cubes](https://apps.apple.com/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884) for Mastodon. I like [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/)'s polish, but I disagree with some design choices, and search/discoverability is lacking.
      * [Captio](http://captio.co/) to send notes to myself. Gmail uses filters to send these to a "Notes" inbox (via "Multiple Inboxes"). Another filter forwards them to my work email if they [contain a keyword](https://thepugautomatic.com/2012/08/captio-with-multiple-recipients/).
      * [Ruler](https://apps.apple.com/app/ruler/id623207505) to measure stuff with an on-screen ruler.

    h2#tv TV and projector

    markdown:

      * [Sony Bravia 55" 4K](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/140-cm-55-inch-tvs). Looks smart, works well. HomeKit and AirPlay.

    figure
      img src="/images/uses/tv.jpg" alt="TV"
      figcaption TV.

    markdown:

      * [Nebula Cosmos Max](https://uk.seenebula.com/products/d2150) projector. Good picture and looks nice.
      * [Nebula Cosmos Mount Stand](https://uk.seenebula.com/products/d0724) to get it on the wall.
      * [Luxburg 100" pull-up screen](https://luxburgvisual.eu/products/luxburg-100-inch-16-9-portable-freestanding-floor-pull-up-projector-screen?variant=37903541403808). Fits under the sofa. Getting wavy. Want to get a pull-down one some time.
      * [Sonos Beam](https://www.sonos.com/shop/beam.html), [Sonos Sub Mini](https://www.sonos.com/shop/sub-mini), and two [Sonos One](https://www.sonos.com/shop/one.html) as surround speakers.
      * **Mac Mini M1, 8 GB RAM**. Drives the TV. We tried an Apple TV but the flexibility of a full computer is hard to beat.
      * **Apple Magic Keyboard** and **Magic Trackpad** as a single unit via the [Spinido Stand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Spinido-BESTAND-Trackpad-MJ2R2LL-Keyboard/dp/B01EWXHV0W?tag=delishlist-20). This is effectively our remote.
      * **Nintendo Switch OLED** for [Mario Kart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_8). We have a two-player setup with a [Pro Controller](https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/-nintendo-switch-pro-controller-000000000002510466), and double joycons in the included Comfort Grip. I miss the Wii steering wheel, but Switch wheels all seem bad.
      * [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) binds function keys to [power the TV on/off and change volume](https://gist.github.com/henrik/32bb3b037b728b81a560d3676c7cfcf7), [toggle input (between Mac Mini and Switch)](https://gist.github.com/henrik/7d8123d8fe0a84fa7f69cbc5a90574a6), [toggle the subwoofer](https://gist.github.com/henrik/437257c1346a33db6dc10a72c61ca807), [open/close](https://gist.github.com/henrik/437257c1346a33db6dc10a72c61ca807) [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), and to toggle lights (in HomeKit via [HomeControl Menu](https://apps.apple.com/app/homecontrol-menu-for-homekit/id1547121417) automation URLs).
      * We watch a lot of movies and TV shows in [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), stored locally. Great if you prefer to watch something specific and not just what's streaming.
      * [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) to download torrents.
      * [Downie](https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/) to download YouTube videos.
      * [NordVPN](https://refer-nordvpn.com/nGLQvpcIgGc) because it comes included with my [Revolut](https://revolut.com) plan. Previously paid for [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressrefer.com/refer-a-friend/30-days-free?referrer_id=22697293&utm_campaign=referrals&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=referral_dashboard) whose app had much better UI. For downloading privacy or to access things from the old homeland.
      * [Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/0028qw) for continuous offsite backup.
      * [Aerial](https://aerialscreensaver.github.io/) screensaver, with stunning aerial shots like on an Apple TV.

    h2#car Car

    markdown:

      * **Honda e Advance** in "charge yellow" with the 17" wheels. Not the most practical car but delightful to drive and look at.

        You can customise the background image on the main displays. I made one with the cat bus from [My Neighbor Totoro](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/).

    markdown:

      * **Andersen A2** charging point, "charcoal" front and "nearly black" sides. Very polished hardware; very unpolished software.

    h2#home Home

    markdown:

      * [Anker 3-in-1 Magnetic Charging Stand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09CKZZTQQ/) by the bed. Replacing the Qi charger with MagSafe was such a quality-of-life improvement – no more aligning it just right.
      * [Velvetiser](https://www.hotelchocolat.com/uk/velvetiser-hot-chocolate-machine.html) "in-home hot chocolate system". Copper. My partner was gifted this. Makes a smooth, frothy cup of cocoa. We use it much more than expected.

        I make it with dairy milk to the lower line, 4 teaspoons of [Cupsmith dark hot chocolate flakes](https://www.cupsmith.com/products/truly-magnificent-hot-chocolate), 1 teaspoon of sugar.
      * [Withings Body+ smart scales](https://www.withings.com/eu/en/body-plus). Really good UI; syncs automatically to Apple Health.
      * [Amazon Basics handheld vacuum](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0BQTN4KK4/). Great on the kitchen counter for crumbs and such.
      * [OnlyCat cat flap](https://onlycat.com/) with prey detection. So nice not to chase mice downstairs in the middle of the night, or clean up their remains in the morning. Startuppy and very responsive team, though I disagree with some priorities regarding privacy.

    h2#gear Gear

    markdown:

      * **iPhone 16** in black. My old gold iPhone 12 Pro was a prettier object, but the action button is convenient for the flashlight, and the Dynamic Island is delightful.
      * **Apple Watch Series 6**. Gold stainless steel with gold Milanese loop.
      * [AirPods Max](https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/) headphones. Noise cancellation is great to have, and the sound stage and quality make music listening on the go an ✨experience✨. Should have had a power button, though.
      * [AirPods Pro 2](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) earbuds. For running and doing chores. Sound quality isn't as good as the Maxes, but it's not bad at all.
      * **Kindle Paperwhite (2021)** e-reader with the black fabric cover.
      * [Fujifilm X100T camera](https://www.kenrockwell.com/fuji/x100t.htm). Realised I'd stopped bringing my DSLR and lenses with me because they were too bulky. Honestly, I rarely even bring this one, these days.
      * [Eastpak Extrafloid](https://www.eastpak.com/backpacks-c120/extrafloid-black-pEK62C07I+00+999.html) backpack.

    h2#ops Ops

    markdown:

      I don't want to manage my own servers if I can help it.

      * Free [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for DNS and most domains.
      * Free [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for static sites like this one.
      * Free [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) for [QED](https://qed.nyh.name).
      * [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) for e.g. [my partner's art site](https://johannaost.com).
      * [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for storing images on S3 and the odd Lambda for automations.

    h2#tea Tea

    markdown:

      My go-tos are:

      * [Twinings English Breakfast](https://twinings.co.uk/products/english-breakfast-40-tea-bags). Had it for breakfast on a recent Disney World trip and learned I rather liked it.
      * [Teapigs Darjeeling Earl Grey](https://www.teapigs.co.uk/products/darjeeling-earl-grey-tea). A bit fancy. Often on a weekend morning.

      Other favourites:

      * [Hebden Tea Earl Grey Summer Blend](https://www.hebdentea.com/product/earl-grey-summer-blend/).
      * [Hebden Tea Blood Orange](https://www.hebdentea.com/product/blood-orange-black-tea/).
      * [Hebden Tea Diamond Blend](https://www.hebdentea.com/product/diamond-blend-earl-grey-cherry/).
      * [Teapigs Yerba Mate](https://www.teapigs.co.uk/products/yerba-mate) for an extra kick of energy.
      * [Thompson's Special Everyday](https://www.thompsonstea.com/our-teas/thompsons-special-everyday), or PG Tips, or Yorkshire Tea – with milk. In order of preference, though I mix it up.
